## What is Entropy-Playground?

Entropy-Playground is an open-source framework for orchestrating AI coding assistants inside secure, reproducible virtual environments. It enables autonomous, role-based AI agents to collaborate on GitHub repositories, working issues, submitting pull requests, and reviewing code â€” all while running in ephemeral cloud or local infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **GitHub Integration**: Native integration with GitHub API for seamless workflow automation
- **Secure Execution**: Sandboxed environments for safe code execution
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents working together
- **Pluggable AI Backends**: Support for Claude, OpenAI, and open-source LLMs
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform and Docker-based deployment
