# Architecture Overview

Entropy-Playground is designed as a modular, extensible framework for orchestrating AI agents that work collaboratively on software development tasks.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Runtime Framework

The agent runtime manages the lifecycle of AI agents:

```
entropy_playground/
├── agents/          # Agent role implementations
├── runtime/         # Core runtime and scheduling
└── cli/            # Command-line interface
```

Key concepts:
- **BaseAgent**: Abstract base class for all agents
- **AgentRegistry**: Manages available agent types
- **TaskScheduler**: Coordinates agent activities

### 2. GitHub Integration Layer

Handles all interactions with GitHub:

```python
entropy_playground/github/
├── client.py       # GitHub API wrapper
├── issues.py       # Issue management
├── pulls.py        # Pull request operations
└── reviews.py      # Code review functionality
```

### 3. Infrastructure Layer

Manages deployment and execution environments:

```
entropy_playground/infrastructure/
├── docker/         # Container management
├── terraform/      # Cloud provisioning
└── security/       # Sandboxing and policies
```

### 4. Logging and Audit System

Provides comprehensive logging and audit trails:

```
entropy_playground/logging/
├── structured.py   # Structured logging
├── audit.py        # Audit trail
└── metrics.py      # Performance metrics
```

## Agent Architecture

Each agent follows a standard lifecycle:

1. **Initialization**: Load configuration and connect to services
2. **Task Discovery**: Find available work (e.g., GitHub issues)
3. **Task Execution**: Perform the assigned work
4. **Result Reporting**: Update GitHub and log results
5. **Cleanup**: Release resources and update state

## Communication Patterns

Agents communicate through:
- **Redis PubSub**: Real-time event notifications
- **Shared State**: Redis-backed state management
- **GitHub API**: Coordination through issues and PRs

## Security Model

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Agents run in isolated containers
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for each agent
- **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged and traceable
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of API keys and tokens

## Deployment Options

1. **Local Development**: Docker Compose
2. **AWS**: ECS/Fargate with auto-scaling
3. **Kubernetes**: Helm charts for K8s deployment
4. **Hybrid**: Mix of local and cloud resources
