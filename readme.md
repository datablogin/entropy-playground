# Entropy-Playground: GitHub-Native AI Coding Agent Framework

## 🚀 Overview

**Entropy-Playground** is an open-source framework for orchestrating AI coding assistants inside secure, reproducible
virtual environments. It enables autonomous, role-based AI agents to collaborate on GitHub repositories, working
issues, submitting pull requests, and reviewing code — all while running in ephemeral cloud or local infrastructure.

Entropy-Playground is designed to:

- Run autonomously on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Leverage open-source AI assistants and tooling
- Provide reproducible environments and secure execution
- Facilitate collaborative workflows across multiple agents

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Autonomous AI development teams working through GitHub issues
- Scaling AI assistants to collaborate on large open-source projects
- Experimenting with multi-agent, role-based coding workflows
- Secure, auditable, sandboxed AI-driven development environments

## 🧱 Architecture

Entropy-Playground consists of:
1️⃣ **Infrastructure Layer**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform recipes for reproducible VM/container launch.

2️⃣ **Agent Runtime Framework**: Python-based framework with:

- Role definitions (Issue Reader, Coder, Reviewer, etc.)
- Multi-agent communication and task coordination
- Pluggable AI backends (Claude Code, Codex, open-source LLMs)

3️⃣ **GitHub Integration**:

- Secure GitHub API access
- Workflow automation (claim issues, submit PRs, request reviews)

4️⃣ **Auditability & Logging**:

- Immutable logs of agent actions
- Annotated PRs and comments for provenance and transparency

## 🔧 MVP Features

- Terraform scripts for AWS VM provisioning
- Docker Compose support for local runs
- Basic CLI for launching and managing agent environments
- Single-agent workflow completing a full GitHub issue lifecycle

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1 (0-2 months): Foundation

- Repository scaffolding and open-source licensing
- Reproducible infrastructure scripts (AWS, Docker Compose)
- CLI for launching dev environments

### Phase 2 (2-4 months): Core Agent Framework

- Role management system
- GitHub API integration for reading issues, opening PRs
- Initial audit/logging framework

### Phase 3 (4-6 months): Multi-Agent Collaboration

- Communication protocols
- Review workflows (agents reviewing each other)
- GitHub Actions integration

### Phase 4 (6-9 months): Pluggable LLM Backends

- Backend API abstraction
- Support for Claude, Codex, and open-source models
- Web UI for monitoring agents

### Phase 5 (9-12 months): Hardening and Community Release

- Secure sandboxing for agent execution
- Auto-scaling support
- First v1.0 open-source release with governance model

## 📈 Success Metrics

- > 80% autonomous completion rate on test issues
- Setup time < 30 mins for new contributors
- 10+ external contributors before v1.0
