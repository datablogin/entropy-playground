Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done so far:

üìê Architecture: AWS-native, ECS + Redis + CloudWatch Logs

üìù Detailed GitHub issues: actionable, scoped for your contributors

üê≥ Starter Docker scaffolding: Dockerfile + Compose, boto3 + Redis stack

No Kubernetes, no Copilot ‚Äî plain AWS CLI + boto3 preferred workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Execution environment: AWS ECS with Fargate
Why ECS/Fargate?

Serverless containers (no EC2 mgmt)

Pre-integrated with AWS CLI/SAM CLI

Pricing is pay-per-use

No Kubernetes complexity, but supports Docker containers natively

2Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub Integration
AgentDev will run as an external service that authenticates to GitHub API securely via a bot account.

Issues/PRs will drive the work queue.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Claude Code Integration
Claude Code is API-based: we just need an environment that securely holds API credentials and makes HTTP calls.

Claude won‚Äôt need any unusual system dependencies (Python + requests/httpx will suffice).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Coordination and state management
Shared state store for agents: AWS ElastiCache (Redis) or SQS queues.

Keeps agent state externalized (coordination-safe) while maintaining logs.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Audit Logging
Logs written to CloudWatch Logs for centralization and auditability.
